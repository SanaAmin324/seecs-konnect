## Troubleshooting

### "Edit Post" button is not showing
**Cause:** You don't own the post and aren't an admin
**Solution:** Only post owners and admins can edit

### "I clicked Delete but nothing happened"
**Cause:** Server error or network issue
**Solution:** Check console (F12) for errors, try again

### "You have already reported this post"
**Cause:** You already reported this post
**Solution:** Each post can only be reported once per user

### Link won't save
**Cause:** Invalid URL format
**Solution:** Make sure URL starts with `https://` or `http://`
